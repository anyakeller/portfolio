We were given a metal part with locating pins and holes of varying geomentry and tasked with producing a gasket which would match it to 0.005\\" of an inch.","First, I took measuements with the caliper set provided, and recorded them on a rough sketch.  From this, I created a Solidworks CAD file with the relevant part geometry.  To attain the ideal fits, I used a chart of ANSI standards as a sizing guide.  To produce the gasket, we were provided 1/32\\" thick PVC stock.  I created a CAM file from the CAD using GibbsCAM.  Because of the flexibility of PVC, I included an extra toolpath offset and a spring pass.  We were also instructed to include an extra 0.003\\" all around, which I was hesitant to include, as it may have been redundant to the offsets I had already considered.  The machined part was slightly oversized, which I attribute to this.  Out of curiosity, I remade the part without the extra 0.003\\" and it fit perfectly."]}},"links":[{"source":"Related CAD, CAM, and image Files","url":"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fpWwhp8ZB6UEoqHbCn-4dvcjxxiQwDuY?usp=sharing"}]},{"project_name":"Worlds Largest Kid-Powered Stomp Rocket","image_folder_path":"chitag_rocket/","image_files":["chitagRocketStageSetup.jpg","handlebarGuardCAM.jpg"],"inProgress":false,"dates":"January 2019 to November 2019","info":{"tags":["SolidWorks","CAD","CAM","SolidCam","Pneumatics","Lathe","Mill","Smooth-On","3D Printing"],"description":{"brief":"An 8-foot tall foam rocket used as an attraction at the Chicago Toy and Game Fair.","verbose":["Participants jumped on stomp pads to build air pressure and press a button to launch the rocket.","Mechanism: Jumping on a stomp pad compresses a foot-powered bicycle pump connected to the launcher.  This resets the launcher piston, sealing off the tank.  A check valve allows pressure to equalize in both chambers as pressure builds from the four stomp pads.  Once the desired pressure is achieved, pushing a red button allows air to escape from the stomp pad side, causing the piston to slide back.  The piston movement compresses a spring until a hard stop is hit and the seal is broken almost instantaneously.  The explosive force from the tank launches the rocket."]}},"links":[{"source":"Video: Prototype 50 psi test launch","url":"https://youtu.be/9N14jaQVq4c"},{"source":"Video: Awards ceremony launch on Kite and Rocket Website","url":"https://kiteandrocket.com/krvideo/worlds-largest-kid-powered-rocket/"}]},{"project_name":"Vacuum Splint","image_folder_path":"","image_files":["vacuumsplint.jpg"],"inProgress":false,"dates":"April 2021 to July 2021","info":{"tags":["casting","3D Printing","FDM","Rotocasting","Smooth-On","SolidWorks","CAD","Lathe","Mill"],"description":{"brief":"This device addresses the symptoms of Peyronie\'s disease which is caused by scar tissue formation on the penis.","verbose":["The project was proposed by a doctor in the field who believed that the current solutions were bulky and ineffective.  I came up with a modularized mechanical solution to the problem inspired by the splint I used when I broke my hand.","The design consists of a foam pad which puts pressure on the bend and can be adjusted by thumbscrew.  The housing was FDM 3D printed.  To maintain the required vacuum seal, I turned multiple segments of polycarbonate tube which could be stacked together and interface with the vacuum pump.  By request, I started another prototype for a balloon-style pressure mechanism.  To manufature the balloon, I tried to rotocast urethane with a mechanism I built, but could not achieve a consitent wall thickness.  My final mold design before leaving the project required a polyurethane melt-away core (expensive, I know), but we found the inflation to be difficult to control, inconsistent, and potentialy dangerous.
