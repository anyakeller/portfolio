My teammate, Zachary Pinard, and I brainstormed ideas for functionality.  The seeder met our constraints on complexity, available resources, and our skillsets.  To clarify our objectives, we restricted the seeds to ones which were spherical, and fairly uniform in size and shape.","The hopper and mechanical dispensing mechanism were chosen after considering alternative solutions such as a vibratory system, and a pneumatic pick-and-place system.  This would allow us to save time and reduce the risk of dropping seeds during conveyance.  Seeds could be loaded into the hopper in bulk, and would be dispensed by funneling them into a moving panel at the bottom of the hopper, which would then shift one seed at a time to an exit opening.","While we originally intended to use a stepper motor and lead screw to actuate the dispensing mechanism, we ran into complications with its gear ratio and had to come up with an alternate solution later into the project.  With the resources available, we chose to use a servo, and replaced the lead screw with a linkage mechanism.  At full speed, most of the seeds would miss or bounce out.  This was solved by regulating the servo\'s speed with pauses between incremental motions.","Two pairs of steel shaft served as guide rails for the hopper.  Stepper motors drove timing belt pulleys to translate the system.  The y-axis rails were kept short to avoid bending the cantilevered rails.  Rigidity was further enforced by the use of hand-machined ABS parts, rather than FDM 3D-printed ones.","Motion and positioning were controlled by G-Code instructions sent to a MKS Arduino Mega board through the Repetier-Host 3D-printing software.  This worked perfectly for the grid layout of the seed bed.  A matlab script was written to generate the G-Code after tweaking speed parameters with hand-written G-Code.  To ensure repeatability, we used the width of an eraser to position the hopper at machine home coordinates upon running a new script."]}},"links":[{"source":"Demo Video","url":"https://youtu.be/WHZUBET6zvY"},{"source":"Download Matlab Script to Generate Seedcode","path":"generateSeedCode.m"},{"source":"Download Seedcode G-Code","path":"seedcode.gcode"}]},{"project_name":"Gasket","image_folder_path":"ME360_gasket/","image_files":["gasket-assembly.jpg","gasket-drawing.jpg"],"inProgress":false,"dates":"Jan 2023","info":{"tags":["SolidWorks","CAD","CAM","GibbsCam","Measuement","coursework"],"description":{"brief":"This gasket was the product of an assignment for the Electromechanical Design course at Boston University.","verbose":["This project was an excercize in measurement and design.

The one above was done afterwards for the fun of it.).  From this, I created a Solidworks CAD file with the relevant part geometry.  To attain the ideal fits, I used a chart of ANSI standards as a sizing guide.  To produce the gasket, we were provided 1/32\\" thick PVC stock.  I created a CAM file from the CAD using GibbsCAM.  Because of the flexibility of PVC, I included an extra toolpath offset and a spring pass.  We were also instructed to include an extra 0.003\\" all around, which I was hesitant to include, as it may have been redundant to the offsets I had already considered.  The machined part was slightly oversized, which I attribute to this.  Out of curiosity, I remade the part without the extra 0.003\\" and it fit perfectly."]}},"links":[{"source":"Related CAD, CAM, and image Files","url":"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fpWwhp8ZB6UEoqHbCn-4dvcjxxiQwDuY?usp=sharing"}]},{"project_name":"Worlds Largest Kid-Powered Stomp Rocket","image_folder_path":"chitag_rocket/","image_files":["chitagRocketStageSetup.jpg","handlebarGuardCAM.jpg"],"inProgress":false,"dates":"January 2019 to November 2019","info":{"tags":["SolidWorks","CAD","CAM","SolidCam","Pneumatics","Lathe","Mill","Smooth-On","3D Printing"],"description":{"brief":"An 8-foot tall foam rocket used as an attraction at the Chicago Toy and Game Fair.","verbose":["Participants jumped on stomp pads to build air pressure and press a button to launch the rocket.","Mechanism: Jumping on a stomp pad compresses a foot-powered bicycle pump connected to the launcher.  This resets the launcher piston, sealing off the tank.  A check valve allows pressure to equalize in both chambers as pressure builds from the four stomp pads.  Once the desired pressure is achieved, pushing a red button allows air to escape from the stomp pad side, causing the piston to slide back.  The piston movement compresses a spring until a hard stop is hit and the seal is broken almost instantaneously.

The housing was FDM 3D printed.  To maintain the required vacuum seal, I turned multiple segments of polycarbonate tube which could be stacked together and interface with the vacuum pump.  By request, I started another prototype for a balloon-style pressure mechanism.  To manufature the balloon, I tried to rotocast urethane with a mechanism I built, but could not achieve a consitent wall thickness.
