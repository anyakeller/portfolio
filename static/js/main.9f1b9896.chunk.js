The pump we constructed in class utilized two bulkheads, sealed with gaskets, and fixed using a bolt pattern. Due to the nature of gaskets, this introduced two sources of variability in the clearance for the pump rotor. We replaced the gaskets with an o-ring seal and eliminated one of the bulkheads. We replaced the bolt circle with a bayonet-lock style attachment mechanism for ease of assembly and maintenance. The bulkhead was designed to be injection molded without the need for side actions. Tolerances were determined through tolerance stacks."}]}},"links":[{"source":"Drawings - google drive link","url":"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xt0bD6iDpHqW0d0dH8FxPV3_RJyAR_ez?usp=sharing"}]},{"project_name":"Closed Loop Control Simulation","image_folder_path":"ME360_vibrations/","image_files":["full_model-min.png","beam_deflection-min.jpg"],"inProgress":false,"dates":"May 2023","info":{"tags":["SolidWorks","FEM","motion analysis","simulation","coursework"],"description":{"brief":"Simulated closed loop control of a vibratory system in SolidWorks","verbose":[{"title":"Assignment Goal","text":"The goal of this Electromechanical Design course assignment was to model the behavior of a friction-induced vibratory system and achieve a constant rotational velocity using closed-loop control."},{"title":"The System","text":"The target mechanism induces frictional vibration between surfaces, using a motor-driven shaft and a block at the end of a steel cantilever.  From this I created a simplified model using the SolidWorks Motion add-in, representing the deflection of the cantilever with a spring, and adding a constant force to keep the block in contact with the shaft.  The part materials were specified as neoprene rubber with the \u201crubber\u201d preset static and kinetic friction coefficients.  I also paid carful attention to the mates I used in order to prevent over-constraining the part with redundancies."},{"title":"Stick-Slip","text":"The oscillatory motion is produced by the spring-mass system.  As the shaft rotates, static friction drags the block upwards, stretching the spring and creating a downward force.  Once the spring force overcomes the friction from the shaft, the block slips and the friction reduces to kinetic friction."},{"title":"Modeling the System","text":"To estimate the spring constant, I used the SolidWorks simulation add-in to predict the deflection of the beam when loaded at one end, which gave the relationship between force and displacement.  I modeled the beam of 12 in length and a 1 in x 0.125 in cross section using Alloy Steel as the material and loaded it with 0.25 lb on one end, and fixed it at the other.  This produced a deflection of ~2.89E-5 in, or 0.0007329 mm.  Dividing the force of the load by the deflection produced k = 1517 N/m or about 8.66 lbf/in."},{"title":"Motion Analysis","text":"I attached a 30 rpm constant-speed motor to the shaft and plotted the output.  For closed loop control, I replaced the motor with an equation-defined torque.  Plotting the angular velocity allowed me to use the instantaneous values in the equation and implement the proportional element of PID tuning.  I defined the torque as some constant, kp, times the difference between the target and instantaneous velocities.  For low values of kp, the motor was not able to overcome the force of friction.  For higher values, it would quickly approach and maintain a level just below the target speed.  I decided to go with kp=0.15 as larger values would cause my computer to crash."}]}},"links":[{"source":"CAD Models, Videos, and Additional Material","url":"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mvD76Cx_3Uzgq8y9Dt65p7kEPYfDIJ-f?usp=sharing"}]},{"project_name":"Seeder","image_folder_path":"ME360_seeder/","image_files":["seeder-min.png","seeder_hopper-min.jpg","seeder_actuation-min.png"],"inProgress":false,"dates":"Feb. 2023","info":{"tags":["SolidWorks","Arduino","G-Code","MatLAB","coursework"],"description":{"brief":"Automatic hydroponic seed planter","verbose":[{"title":"Project Goals","text":"The goal of this Electromechanical Design course assignment was to produce a 2.5-axis, belt-driven, cartesian motion system.

My company\'s partnership with a certain well-known toy manufacturer made building a giant foam rocket launcher the obvious option. At the awards ceremony, we launched the rocket over the crowd of dinner guests. At the fair, kids lined up to pressurize the rocket by jumping on a group of four spring-loaded \\"stomp pads\\" (like a gymnastics springboard), and launched it by smacking a big red button. The kids loved it. The adults loved it. Nobody got hurt. I\'d call that a success."},{"title":"Mechanism Overview","text":"I fitted the spring-loaded \\"stomp pads\\" with foot-powered bicycle pumps to build air pressure in the launch chamber. During demos at the fair, we limited it to 35 psi. Pressing a red button ventilated pressure in the rear chamber of a large piston within the launch tube. The difference in pressure caused the piston to slide back, which opened a face seal in the front. The rocket, which was loaded onto the front of the launch tube, was then expelled with the escaping air."},{"title":"Stomp Pad Pressurization Mechanism","text":"I CNC machined marine grade plywood for the base and the jumping platform. I modified a foot-powered bicycle pump to connect to 1/4 npt pipe fittings. I press-fit the pump into channels cut into the base and added a strip of bent spring steel to provide extra springiness and a nylon webbing strip prevented the stomp pad from opening up too wide. I added aluminum handlebars and padded them with foam yoga blocks to prevent kids from smacking their heads on the handlebars. Rubber feet underneath the stomp pads and rubber stops within them cushioned the downstroke. The four stomp pads were connected with brackets for additional stability. The air hoses from the pads were joined at a manifold which was also connected to the launch button, a pressure gage, and the rear end of the launch tube."},{"title":"Launching Mechanism Resetting and Pressurizing","text":"The polycarbonate launch tube served as both the pressure vessel and launching mechanism for the rocket. I CNC machined and then turned a large plunger out of polycarbonate which divided the cylinder into two chambers. The plunger was connected to a cast urethane stopper by a thinner polycarbonate tube. In its initial state, the piston is situated toward the back of the launcher, the plunger is retracted, and the front chamber is open to the air. When air from the stomp pads initially entered the rear chamber, the minimal pressure pushed the piston forward, sealing off the face. A check valve in the plunger allowed air pressure to equalize between the chambers once the pressure reached the cracking pressure, and also prevented the backflow of air."},{"title":"Launching Mechanism","text":"Pushing a red button allowed air to escape from the rear piston chamber. The difference in pressure caused the piston to slide back. To create an \\"explosive\\" launching effect, rather than a sad hiss, I designed an additional mechanism for the front seal. The pressure behind the front seal kept it in place as the piston rod drew back along a stainless steel shaft, compressing a spring. I machined a hard stop collar for the shaft which, after making contact with another stop on the piston tube, pulled the shaft backward along with the face seal. With the front seal broken, the force of the spring instantaneously snapped the face seal further back, creating an even wider opening for air to escape. This generated the explosion of air required to launch the rocket."},{"title":"Design Considerations and Machining","text":"The entire mechanism was designed to easily serviceable. I used a combination of quick-disconnects, barbed fittings, and 1/4 npt threaded hose connectors for the air lines. Screws were standardized across assemblies. The rear bulkhead was attached with a bolt pattern to a rim which was fixed to the launching tube. This allowed me to re-grease the o-ring on the launcher piston. To machine the parts, I utilized CNC mills, manual mills and lathes. I nested aluminum pipe  for the handlebars and used grenade pins for height adjustment. I machined foam yoga blocks for the handlebar padding. I cast the urethane face seal over a CNC machined HDPE part, which I used to connect it to the steel shaft with a series of turned parts, shaft collars, and a PVC pipe fitting from McMaster which I machined the *heck* out of. The launcher piston was machined in two halves out of polycarbonate which I then bonded together, turned on a lathe and tapped. I attached the front bulkhead with a ring of steel pins and added an o-ring to seal it. I press fit six steel rods into the front bulkhead to serve as guide rails for the front seal plunger. I designed the rocket to resemble a toy rocket in CAD, and we had it cut out of hard foam by an outside supplier. I 3D printed a mold and cast the nose cones out of urethane. We glued the sections together and inserted a thin polycarbonate tube in the center for reinforcement and wrapped the whole damn thing in vinyl decals. I could go on..."},{"title":"Challenges","text":"I spent a fair amount of time experimenting with adhesives as many caused crazing in the acrylic bulkheads. I also had to develop a strategy for casting the nose cones without bubbles. This was solved by using a vacuum chamber to degass the casting mixture and ventilation holes in the top of the mold to allow heat and gas to escape. During the fair, the bolts in the stomp pads would occasionally unscrew themselves which I would then discretely pocket\u2013which was not great. The plywood stomp pads also ripped themselves apart. I re-machined the stomp pads out of Polypropylene and used loctite on all of the bolts. The nose cones had a tendency to snap off and we had to glue them back on during the fair. This could be solved by reinforcing the nose cone connection to the rocket body."}]}},"links":[{"source":"Video: Prototype 50 psi test launch","url":"https://youtu.be/9N14jaQVq4c"},{"source":"Video: Explanation of mechanism design on Kite and Rocket Website","url":"https://kiteandrocket.com/krvideo/the-making-of-the-worlds-largest-kid-powered-ten-foot-rocket/"},{"source":"Video: Awards ceremony launch on Kite and Rocket Website","url":"https://kiteandrocket.com/krvideo/worlds-largest-kid-powered-rocket/"}]},{"project_name":"Vacuum Splint","image_folder_path":"vacuum_splint/","image_files":["vacuumsplint-min.jpg","vacuum_splint_semiassembled-min.jpeg"],"inProgress":false,"dates":"April 2021 to July 2021","info":{"tags":["casting","3D printing","FDM","rotocasting","Smooth-On","SolidWorks","CAD","machining","lathe","mill"],"description":{"brief":"This device addresses the symptoms of Peyronie\'s disease which is caused by scar tissue formation on the penis.","verbose":["The project was proposed by a doctor in the field who believed that the current solutions were bulky and ineffective.
