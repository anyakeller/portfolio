      "description": "This project was the complete teardown and reconstruction of the Kite and Rocket website.  Having never used wordpress or PHP before, I was tasked with digging through the source code and figuring out how everything worked under the hood.  In addition to cleaning up layers of overwritten code, updating packages, and redesigning the UI, I implemented mobile-responsive breakpoints, a touchscreen-friendly swipable carousel, video sharing functionality, amongst other improvements.  I also imporved upon the wordpress dashboard interface and created a custom worpress post type plugin.  In the main directory I left a readme file with carful documentation and usage instructions for the next webmaster.  Note: the wesbite in its current state may not accurately reflect the last version I worked on."
