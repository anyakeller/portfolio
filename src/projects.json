        "verbose": [
          "The goal of this Electromechanical Design course assignment was to model the behavior of a friction-induced vibratory system and achieve a constant rotational velocity using closed-loop control.",
          "The target mechanism induces frictional vibration between surfaces, using a motor-driven shaft and a block at the end of a steel cantilever.  From this I created a simplified model using the Solidworks Motion add-in, representing the deflection of the cantilever with a spring, and adding a constant force to keep the block in contact with the shaft.  The part materials were specified as neoprene rubber with the “rubber” preset static and kinetic friction coefficients.  I also paid carful attention to the mates I used in order to prevent over-constraining the part with redundancies.",
          "The oscillatory motion is produced by the spring-mass system.  As the shaft rotates, static friction drags the block upwards, stretching the spring and creating a downward force.  Once the spring force overcomes the friction from the shaft, the block slips and the friction reduces to kinetic friction.",
          "To estimate the spring constant, I used the SolidWorks simulation add-in to predict the deflection of the beam when loaded at one end, which gave the relationship between force and displacement.  I modeled the beam of 12 in length and a 1 in x 0.125 in cross section using Alloy Steel as the material and loaded it with 0.25 lb on one end, and fixed it at the other.  This produced a deflection of ~2.89E-5 in, or 0.0007329 mm.  Dividing the force of the load by the deflection produced k = 1517 N/m or about 8.66 lbf/in.",
          "I attached a 30 rpm constant-speed motor to the shaft and plotted the output.  For closed loop control, I replaced the motor with an equation-defined torque.  Plotting the angular velocity allowed me to use the instantaneous values in the equation and implement the proportional element of PID tuning.  I defined the torque as some constant, kp, times the difference between the target and instantaneous velocities.  For low values of kp, the motor was not able to overcome the force of friction.  For higher values, it would quickly approach and maintain a level just below the target speed.  I decided to go with kp=0.15 as larger values would cause my computer to crash."

          "The goal of this Electromechanical Design course assignment was to produce a 2.5-axis, belt-driven, cartesian motion system.  My teammate, Zachary Pinard, and I brainstormed ideas for functionality.  The seeder met our constraints on complexity, available resources, and our skillsets.  To clarify our objectives, we restricted the seeds to mustard seeds, which were spherical, and fairly uniform in size and shape.",
          "The hopper and mechanical dispensing mechanism were chosen after considering alternative solutions such as a vibratory system, and a pneumatic pick-and-place system.  This would allow us to save time and reduce the risk of dropping seeds during conveyance.  Seeds could be loaded into the hopper in bulk, and would be dispensed by funneling them into a moving panel at the bottom of the hopper, which would then shift one seed at a time to an exit opening.",
          "While we originally intended to use a stepper motor and lead screw to actuate the dispensing mechanism, we ran into complications with its gear ratio and had to come up with an alternate solution later into the project.  With the resources available, we chose to use a servo, and replaced the lead screw with a linkage mechanism.  At full speed, most of the seeds would miss or bounce out.  This was solved by regulating the servo's speed with pauses between incremental motions.",
          "Two pairs of steel shaft served as guide rails for the hopper.  Stepper motors drove timing belt pulleys to translate the system.  The y-axis rails were kept short to avoid bending the cantilevered rails.  Rigidity was further enforced by the use of hand-machined ABS parts, rather than FDM 3D-printed ones.",
          "Motion and positioning were controlled by G-Code instructions sent to a MKS Arduino Mega board through the Repetier-Host 3D-printing software.  This worked perfectly for the grid layout of the seed bed.  A matlab script was written to generate the G-Code after tweaking speed parameters with hand-written G-Code.  To ensure repeatability, we used the width of an eraser to position the hopper at machine home coordinates upon running a new script."

          "First, I took measurements with the caliper set provided, and recorded them on a rough sketch (not pictured because I may have lost it.  The one above was done afterwards for the fun of it.).  From this, I created a Solidworks CAD file with the relevant part geometry.  To attain the ideal fits, I used a chart of ANSI standards as a sizing guide.  To produce the gasket, we were provided 1/32\" thick PVC stock.  I created a CAM file from the CAD using GibbsCAM.  Because of the flexibility of PVC, I included an extra toolpath offset and a spring pass.  We were also advised to include an extra 0.003\" all around, which I was hesitant to include, as it may have been redundant to the offsets I had already considered.  The machined part was slightly oversized, which confirmed my suspicions.  Out of curiosity, I remade the part without the extra 0.003\" and it fit perfectly."

A check valve allows pressure to equalize in both chambers as pressure builds from the four stomp pads.  Once the desired pressure is achieved, pushing a red button allows air to escape from the stomp pad side, causing the piston to slide back.  The piston movement compresses a spring until a hard stop is hit and the seal is broken almost instantaneously.  The explosive force from the tank launches the rocket."

To maintain the required vacuum seal, I turned multiple segments of polycarbonate tube which could be stacked together and interface with the vacuum pump.  By request, I started another prototype for a balloon-style pressure mechanism.  To manufature the balloon, I tried to rotocast urethane with a mechanism I built, but could not achieve a consitent wall thickness.  My final mold design before leaving the project required a polyurethane melt-away core (expensive, I know), but we found the inflation to be difficult to control, inconsistent, and potentialy dangerous.  The client ultimately agreed that a mechanical screw mechanism would be the preferred choice."
